## Welcome!
My name is Jeremy Jang. I am currently a Master's student studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California. Previously I completed my Bachelor's at New York University in May 2023, where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Mathematics.

I am committed to ongoing personal and professional development, so I am always eager to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge. I take my work very seriously and always try to give my all to ensure that things are done properly and all bases are covered.

My most recent work experience was at Amazon, where I was a Software Engineer Intern under the Alexa For Everyone org (AFE-16) at HQ2 over the course of September 2022 - December 2022. I am currently looking for any software related intern opportunities for Summer 2024.
