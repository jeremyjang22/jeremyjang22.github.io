## Welcome!
My name is Jeremy Jang. I am currently a Master's student studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California. Previously I completed my Bachelor's at New York University in May 2023, where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Mathematics.

I am committed to ongoing personal and professional development, so I am always eager to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge. I take my work very seriously and always try to give my all to ensure that things are done properly and all bases are covered.

For more information, see my [resume](pdf/resume.pdf) (_Updated as of 11/22/2023_).
